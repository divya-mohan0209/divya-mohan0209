**Hello There!** :wave:

I'm **Divya Mohan** & here are some of the things I do (in no particular order).

- **SIG Docs Co Chair** with **Kubernetes**
- **SIG Docs lead** with **Litmus Chaos**
- Lead a team of System Engineers
- Occasional non-code, non-documentation things. you can find them [here](https://github.com/divya-mohan0209/talks)

I love reading books & taking long walks. Also, my cats (who demanded they be mentioned here). I work at [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.co.in/) as a Senior Systems Admin. If you'd like to talk about any of these or AMA (within reason), I'm glad to connect over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Divya_Mohan02).
