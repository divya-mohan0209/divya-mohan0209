**Hello There!** :wave:

- :snake: Currently working on mini projects to level up my Python dev knowledge. On the Google Season of Docs' 2020 with CERN HSF working on Rucio & an AWS Community Builder.
- :books: I'm learning Javascript (brushing up, really!) and some Serverless tech - AWS Lambda, SNS, API Gateway (you get the drift! :wink:)
- :cloud: I'd like to collaborate on some really cool serverless projects.
- :thought_balloon: **Ask me about:**  I'm a systems afficionado, so probably systems? And oh, documentation!
- :email: Reach me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Divya_Mohan02) OR [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divya-mohan0209/)
