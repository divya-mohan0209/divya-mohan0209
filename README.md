**Hello There!** :wave:

I'm a systems nerd who codes occasionally and **LOVES** great documentation. With the tendency to treat my life as an ongoing project in learning, my latest exploits are:

- Working with **CERN-HSF** on **Google Season of Docs** to modify & restructure their documentation
- Learning **AWS Amplify & Device Farm** whilst brushing up on ReactJS 
- On the systems side, I am delving a bit more into the kernel of the Linux distro & learning k8s. 

I also do some non-code, non-system things occasionally & you can find them [here](https://github.com/divya-mohan0209/talks)

I love reading books & long walks. Also, my cat (who demanded he be mentioned here). I work at [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.co.in/) as a Senior Systems Admin. If you'd like to talk about any of these or AMA (within reason), I'm glad to connect over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Divya_Mohan02).
